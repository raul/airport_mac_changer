# Airport MAC Changer

Script to quickly change your Airport's MAC address.

Some wifi hotspots give a limited connection time or bandwith for each device by
looking its MAC address, so with this gem you may get a new MAC address and get connected again.

## Installation

    gem install airport_mac_change

## Usage:

Execute

    airport_mac_change

enter your root password when you're asked for it and wait a bit. 

If you're currently connected to some network, you'll be automatically desconnected 
to apply the MAC change and automatically reconnected after.

## Supported platforms
Currently tested only in Snow Leopard, please let me know if it works in a different platform.
